    Did “positive thinking” and “mental science” help put Donald Trump in the White House? And are there other kinds of “occult politics” at work in the world today?

    In my book Dark Star Rising: Magick and Power in the Age of Trump, I look at the strange magical and esoteric ideas that are informing postmodern politics in the United States and Russia in the twenty-first century.

    From New Thought to Chaos Magick to the far-right esotericism of Julius Evola and the Traditionalists, a web of connections stretches out across the globe bringing together such disparate characters and phenomena as Norman Vincent Peale, Pepe the Frog, the Alt-Right, Vladimir Putin, President Trump, Reality TV, “meme magick” and much else in a weird tangle of postmodern occultism in which reality is up for grabs, facts give way to internet fictions, and truth is a negotiable commodity.

    My talk will look at this post-truth alternative fact landscape in which reality is defined as what you can get away with.

  type: Lecture
  keynote: 1
  avatarPath: https://www.occultureberlin.org/images/speakers/arts-helene.jpg
  description: 'This multi-media presentation will cover a spectrum between terror
    and humour as the concepts of Meaning, Will and Death are explored from a Left-Hand
    Path perspective. Eschewing all god/dess forms and their patronage and oversight,
    unflinching answers to the questions of Who Am I, Why Am I Here, and What Happens
    Next, are asked of the Magician. Central to this discussion is the philosophy
    of New Existentialism developed by the brilliant British philosopher and author
    Colin Wilson. This talk will explore how New Existentialism applies to these questions
    and, by extension, to contemporary Left-Hand Path thinking and magickal practice.
    Weaving practical application with serious thought, the goal of this talk is to
    contribute to the discussion of the awareness and intentionality of the Self:
    may this nourish a deep and rich perspective on how to live with meaning and joy
    as a human being, and power and potency as a Magician.'
  bio: Magick and the Occult are Helene's life-long passions. Her work in these realms
    has been influenced in particular by Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, philosopher
    Colin Wilson, and Witchcraft of a Left-Hand Path persuasion. She has been a professional
    Astrologer for over 20 years and regularly teaches and writes on a variety of
    occult-related topics. Her work revolves around the themes of existential meaning,
    Will, and death, and her practice is focused on planetary and astrological magick.
    Helene is the founder and owner of Witch Hollow, a 25 acre forest sanctuary in
    Ontario, Canada, dedicated to magickal practice and public education (witchhollow.ca).
    Helene is a contributing author to PILLARS ‘The Scalding of Sapientia', and "Circling

    The magical origins of this civilization are becoming clearer as archaeologists
    and scholars piece together the Hellenic world before Plato, a world of magicians
    and prophets. Out of the magical currents of the 20th century a new generation
    of mystery schools is emerging and re-presenting the practices of these ancient
    schools. How can knowledge of the ancient world help us to understand our civilization’s
    current plight? And more importantly, what do we have to help us reach back to
    that eternal source and dream the magical heart of a new civilization?

    for hire to their local communities. Merging the parallel strands of Grimoire
    magic and Book of Secrets charms, they operated across all levels of society,
    often working from a book of practice of the charms and conjurations that worked
    effectively and regularly for them. The Cunning-Man and Cunning-Woman stand out
    as the predecessors of the modern resurgence of folk magic and spirit work, and
    I will be exploring their magic from ancient roots through to contemporary practices,
    including examples of some of the most prominent Cunning practitioners and their

    tube.\n\nHis journey finally brings him face to face with the goddess of primordial
    waters, Danu, who gave her name to the Don.\n\nWhile using the river Don as the
    focal point for a psycho-geographical journey, at heart this is a meditation on
    the symbolic and ritual power of water and its association with feminine power.

    perfection. \nThe Emerald Tablet, a root text of alchemy, embodies all aspects
    of alchemical work and can be read as both a physical and non-material process.
    The challenge in the practice of alchemy is in the union of these two views. Working
    with a new translation of the Emerald Tablet, I will examine this text in light
    of the inner and outer practices of alchemy and its implications and possibilities
    for any creative work."

  description: 'There is hardly any being that is so archetypal as that of the wicked
    adversary. This being has many shapes: The devil, demons, maleficent sorcerers,
    and witches. They all tempt, seduce, challenge, and destroy. Around the early
    20th century the notion arises that the wicked adversary is a projection of the
    repressed aspects of the self. Rudolf Steiner calls this "der Doppelgänger" or
    the guardian of the threshold, which represents the disowned, unwanted, and dark
    aspects of a person. According to Steiner, it is essential that a spiritual practitioners
    purifies, transforms, and integrates these aspects of themselves. I will explore
    these ideas and present research on Anthroposophic practitioners who claim to
    have met this being, including reports from my own meditative adventures and encounters
    with such a sensed, evil presence.'

    The English writer and self proclaimed radical Traditionalist John
    Michell (1933-2009) occupied an outstanding position within the
    alternative religious landscape of Britain. By means of his influential
    Sacred Place Theory he aimed to re-sanctify the English landscape, and to launch a revived Golden Age with Glastonbury as point of departure.
    The numerological elaboration of his theory is the New Jerusalem
    Diagram, a geometrical map of the Heavenly City, linking contemporary
    Glastonbury to the lost Atlantis and to the prospective New Jerusalem.

  bio: Marleen is a PhD Candidate at the University of Vienna at the Department of
    Religious Studies. Most of her previous study and research projects were dealing

    or the religious impacts within the psychedelic movement. Currently she is working
    on her publication on John Michell’s Sacred Place Theory and on her PhD dissertation
    on Kundalini within the Occult and Holistic Milieu. Originally from the Austrian
    countryside Marleen has been living in Vienna for the last ten years from where
    she was part-time working, studying and travelling.

  description: |-
    Shamanism is a worldwide, ancient practice that has increasingly been experiencing a resurgence in the Western World. At the same time, there has also been a rise in people searching to learn more about their ancestry, in particular amongst the children of European immigrants in North America. For many, the shamanism of Indigenous cultures doesn’t satisfy what they are searching for as it is not tied to their ancestral heritage. With approximately 80 million people from all over the world having Celtic heritage, Celtic shamanism has gradually grown alongside the New Age movement and into present day.

    Celtic shamanism opens up the door for many people to reconnect to their lineage and by doing so, rediscover themselves. When we work with our ancestors, we reconnect to the rhythms of the Earth and what it truly means to belong. In this lecture, Kyra will be sharing her personal experience with Celtic shamanism, awakening, and the importance of seeking out our own ancestry.
  bio: "Kyra Jacques-Grundy is the creatrix of Nox Tarot and one half of the team
    at Otherworld Retreats. She is originally from the traditional, ancestral, and
    unceded territory of the Coast Salish peoples, also known as Vancouver, Canada.
    Her spiritual journey truly began in 2013 when she began seeing an energy healer.
    After feeling called to heal others for a long time, Kyra received her first tarot
    deck in 2015 and has been reading the cards for others ever since. In March 2019,
    she began her training in Celtic shamanism under John Matthews and experienced
    a spiritual awakening. \n"

  description: This Lecture will elucidate the mystical plant Iboga. In Western Equatorial
    Africa, the root bark of the shrub Tabernanthe Iboga has been considered a sacred
    tool for centuries. It serves as medicine as well as a catalyst for spiritual
    initiation. Massive doses of Iboga induce several day long near-death-experiences
    that cause the astral body to detach from the physical body. The Initiate wanders
    the ancestral realms and astral planes, gains information about karmic entanglements
    and learns about the hidden forces of the cosmos.
  bio: Eudaimon has worked with and loved the Tabernanthe Iboga shrub since 2006.
    After experiencing its enourmous healing qualities himself, he immersed deeply
    into research and work with the sacred wood. Besides helping others to witness
    and decode the ancient wisdom of Iboga for healing purposes as well as for psycho-spiritual
    discovery, he writes, talks and organises Events evolving around Iboga.

    In the early 1970s, Timothy Leary began to receive cosmic transmissions in what has become known as the “Starseed” transmissions. At the same time, Robert Anton Wilson found himself in his “Chapel Perilous,” receiving transmissions from somewhere around Sirius. This marked a turn in the thinking of both Leary and Wilson towards cosmic futurism as well as the beginning of their collaboration.

    This talk wants to explore the implications of the transmissions for their collaboration which they called SMI2LE (Space Migration, Increased Intelligence, Life Extension). This was on one hand a magical project that wanted to use collective will and language to actualise a desired future while it, on the other, can be seen as a forerunner to transhumanism, embracing technology and libertarianism, aiming to create a new type of human through the reception of channelled texts.
  bio: 'Dr. Kasper Opstrup is a writer and researcher based in Copenhagen. The Danish
    translator of Alexander Trocchi and William Burroughs, among others, he is currently
    working on a project about Cosmic Futurism while finishing a monograph with the

    and the Politics of Hope. His most recent books are The Way Out: Invisible Insurrections
    and Radical Imaginaries in the UK Underground from 1961 to 1991 (Minor Compositions,
    2017) and the edited anthology Unexpected Encounters – Possible Futures (Antipyrine,
    2019).'
