  description: |-
    In the early 1970s, Timothy Leary began to receive cosmic transmissions in what has become known as the “Starseed” transmissions. At the same time, Robert Anton Wilson found himself in his “Chapel Perilous,” receiving transmissions from somewhere around Sirius. This marked a turn in the thinking of both Leary and Wilson towards cosmic futurism as well as the beginning of their collaboration.

    This talk wants to explore the implications of the transmissions for their collaboration which they called SMI2LE (Space Migration, Increased Intelligence, Life Extension). This was on one hand a magical project that wanted to use collective will and language to actualise a desired future while it, on the other, can be seen as a forerunner to transhumanism, embracing technology and libertarianism, aiming to create a new type of human through the reception of channelled texts.

  description: 'As Gods Fall'' celebrates the 10th year of existence for the German
    ritual ambient project Vortex. It is the final part of a mythical trilogy that
    began with “Kali Yuga” (2013) and “Moloch” (2015). Inspired by the Nordic mythology
    of the Edda, this performance revives the realm of the Old Gods in their final
    conflict. This musical reflection on mythology is used as a metaphor for a portrait
    of the present world out of balance. The tracks were composed after a intense
    journey to the ancient viking relics of Scandinavia in 2015: ''Breathing the air
    of history I felt ultimately connected to the past and heritage of the old Germanic
    tribes and their mythology, also understanding what this all means for what happens
    in the world today. "As Gods Fall" is a cycle of music invoking forgotten energies
    and lost wisdom...'''
  bio: 'Vortex is a dark ambient ritual project, founded by musician Marcus Stiglegger
    (:Golgatha:, MARS) in 2008. The main focus is to channel mythical and primordial
    energies through the use of voice, percussion, field recordings and processed
    sounds. In unique live rituals these soundscapes are combined with cinematic visuals
    to create a multisensorial experience. Vortex has released 5 official albums (Tesco,
    Cyclic Law) and various soundtracks for films and installations. '

    Africa, the root bark of the shrub Tabernanthe Iboga has been considered a sacred
    tool for centuries. It serves as medicine as well as a catalyst for spiritual
    initiation. Massive doses of Iboga induce several day long near-death-experiences
    that cause the astral body to detach from the physical body. The Initiate wanders
    the ancestral realms and astral planes, gains information about karmic entanglements
    and learns about the hidden forces of the cosmos.
  bio: Eudaimon has worked with and loved the Tabernanthe Iboga shrub since 2006.
    After experiencing its enourmous healing qualities himself, he immersed deeply
    into research and work with the sacred wood. Besides helping others to witness
    and decode the ancient wisdom of Iboga for healing purposes as well as for psycho-spiritual
    discovery, he writes, talks and organises Events evolving around Iboga.

    Shamanism is a worldwide, ancient practice that has increasingly been experiencing a resurgence in the Western World. At the same time, there has also been a rise in people searching to learn more about their ancestry, in particular amongst the children of European immigrants in North America. For many, the shamanism of Indigenous cultures doesn’t satisfy what they are searching for as it is not tied to their ancestral heritage. With approximately 80 million people from all over the world having Celtic heritage, Celtic shamanism has gradually grown alongside the New Age movement and into present day.

    Celtic shamanism opens up the door for many people to reconnect to their lineage and by doing so, rediscover themselves. When we work with our ancestors, we reconnect to the rhythms of the Earth and what it truly means to belong. In this lecture, Kyra will be sharing her personal experience with Celtic shamanism, awakening, and the importance of seeking out our own ancestry.
  bio: "Kyra Jacques-Grundy is the creatrix of Nox Tarot and one half of the team
    at Otherworld Retreats. She is originally from the traditional, ancestral, and
    unceded territory of the Coast Salish peoples, also known as Vancouver, Canada.
    Her spiritual journey truly began in 2013 when she began seeing an energy healer.
    After feeling called to heal others for a long time, Kyra received her first tarot
    deck in 2015 and has been reading the cards for others ever since. In March 2019,
    she began her training in Celtic shamanism under John Matthews and experienced
    a spiritual awakening. \n"

    the guardian of the threshold, which represents the disowned, unwanted, and dark
