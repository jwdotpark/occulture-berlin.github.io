An enigmatic soundtrack fuses with breathtaking imagery to create a journey of insight and wonder. Fusing unusual sounds and music with state of the art computer animation technology, Caught Between Worlds is a journey into worlds that can only be described through technology.</div><div class='bio justifed'>Beny Tchaicovsky (1954-2009) was a multimedia award-winning computer artist and visionary. His art has been categorized as Surrealism or Fantastic Realism, he termed his art as”Esoteric Realism”, in which creativity is used as a tool for Consciousness exploration. In the early 90’s, Tchaicovsky began expanding his two-dimensional paintings into 3D animation and in the process became one of the pioneering artists who contributed to the history of 3D animation as an art form. His work has appeared worldwide since it was featured in the “Gate to the Mind’s Eye” and “Odyssey into the Mind’s Eye”. It stood out because it was one of the few 3D works that deserved to be called truly creative, meaningful and artistic. </div></div><div class='button ga-track' data-tracker='get-tickets-speaker-page-caught-between-worlds'><script data-state='' src='https://www.universe.com/embed2.js'></script><a class='button ga-track' href='https://www.universe.com/events/occulture-esoteric-conference-2019-tickets-berlin-86HFLD'>Get Tickets</a></div></section>
