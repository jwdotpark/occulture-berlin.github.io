Gain a better awareness by discovering more about Maya (the illusory world we live in) and it's pervasive influence on your life. Jason discusses what makes you a victim of your own mind and how to release yourself from the clutches of Maya. The workshop is an interactive guided journey away from the fantasy and into the 'self.' Starting with a reality check through visualisation, he introduces the concept of Maya and helps you to differentiate between the illusion and the truth. Jason then goes on to discuss the universal 'truths' we tell ourselves and teaches you to change that perception by altering your physical reality. Finally, with your heightened awareness and understanding of Maya, he encourages you to look back at yourself and question what you think is real. Expect to shake things up! </div><div class='bio justifed'>Jason Revere is here to call bullshit on the “yoga” world, at least in regards to enlightenment. He has 23 years of yoga and meditation practice, and 20 of those years as a teacher, with two yoga schools in Amsterdam. As a victim of his pursuit of enlightenment via yoga, Mr. Revere has authored his process of waking up in his book GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASANA. Jason is best summed up as an experienced, no bullshit, yogi whose crazy eyes don’t stop until people pause, take a breath and question their own reality.
