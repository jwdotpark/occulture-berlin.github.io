At the same time, there has also been a rise in people searching to learn more about their ancestry, in particular amongst the children of European immigrants in North America. For many, the shamanism of Indigenous cultures doesnâ€™t satisfy what they are searching for as it is not tied to their ancestral heritage. With approximately 80 million people from all over the world having Celtic heritage, Celtic shamanism has gradually grown alongside the New Age movement and into present day.
Celtic shamanism opens up the door for many people to reconnect to their lineage and by doing so, rediscover themselves. When we work with our ancestors, we reconnect to the rhythms of the Earth and what it truly means to belong. In this lecture, Kyra will be sharing her personal experience with Celtic shamanism, awakening, and the importance of seeking out our own ancestry.</div><div class='bio justifed'>Kyra Jacques-Grundy is the creatrix of Nox Tarot and one half of the team at Otherworld Retreats. She is originally from the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish peoples, also known as Vancouver, Canada. Her spiritual journey truly began in 2013 when she began seeing an energy healer. After feeling called to heal others for a long time, Kyra received her first tarot deck in 2015 and has been reading the cards for others ever since. In March 2019, she began her training in Celtic shamanism under John Matthews and experienced a spiritual awakening.
