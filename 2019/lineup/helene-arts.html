Eschewing all god/dess forms and their patronage and oversight, unflinching answers to the questions of Who Am I, Why Am I Here, and What Happens Next, are asked of the Magician. Central to this discussion is the philosophy of New Existentialism developed by the brilliant British philosopher and author Colin Wilson. This talk will explore how New Existentialism applies to these questions and, by extension, to contemporary Left-Hand Path thinking and magickal practice. Weaving practical application with serious thought, the goal of this talk is to contribute to the discussion of the awareness and intentionality of the Self: may this nourish a deep and rich perspective on how to live with meaning and joy as a human being, and power and potency as a Magician.</div><div class='bio justifed'>Magick and the Occult are Helene's life-long passions. Her work in these realms has been influenced in particular by Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, philosopher Colin Wilson, and Witchcraft of a Left-Hand Path persuasion. She has been a professional Astrologer for over 20 years and regularly teaches and writes on a variety of occult-related topics. Her work revolves around the themes of existential meaning, Will, and death, and her practice is focused on planetary and astrological magick. Helene is the founder and owner of Witch Hollow, a 25 acre forest sanctuary in Ontario, Canada, dedicated to magickal practice and public education (witchhollow.ca). Helene is a contributing author to PILLARS ‘The Scalding of Sapientia', and "Circling the Compass", and her book “The Last Path on the Left” will be published in early 2020 (anathemapublishing.com). She has also written two other books in the field of conflict resolution, and is currently pursuing a Doctorate in Philosophy.</div></div></section>
