Fear makes things become alive. Fear is a wonderful force for magic. But mostly, fear creates the unwanted.
All the suppressed ideas of the dualistic human mind becomes devils and demons and get strong in the infinite spaces of the subconsciousness.
My paintings bring these entities back to the divine spheres.
I make them holy again and honour them with a halo.
I dig them out of the depth of religion and myths.
My icons are the gates to the forgotten and bedeviled gods.
Transformation by reversal, enlightening by darkness.
Face your demons!
Enter the gates of the icons!
Fear is a god!
</div><div class='bio justifed'>Christian Ermel is a painter who explores the dark sides.
He was born in Berlin in 1971 and did his first painting when he was 10 years old. His family trained him in fine arts and he learned by autodidactical practise.
Since his childhood, visions of dark spaces and entities appeared in his dreams. He became a seeker on the magical path, combining the studies of the occult with his paintings. He transformed the sinister faces of the demonic spheres into holy spirits and did a lot of artwork for musicians, especially from the Black and Death Metal scene.
But because of his withdrawn living and the dark atmosphere of his art, he has had only a few exhibitions for nearly 30 years. Now he is showing his art to the world.</div></div></section>
