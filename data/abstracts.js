We’ll explore some of the best and worst practices for combining the techniques effectively, and how formal structures influence the narrative of our lives, including geometry in space, metre in time, and myth, metaphor and plotline.</p>"

    "title": "Bwa Kayiman and the Simbi-Makaya Egregor",
    "avatar-path": "images/speakers/cussans-john-red.jpg",
    "abstract": "<p>The signal event of the Haitian Revolution was a Vodou ceremony that took place in Bwa Kayiman (Alligator Woods) in August 1791. According to popular legend the Houngan Dutty Boukman and Mambo Cecile Fatiman oversaw a rite in which a Kreyol pig was sacrificed to the Black God of the African slaves and to the Spirit of Liberty. Scholarly speculation about the specific nature of the rite is divided between those who believe it to have been a Dahomian blood-oath, binding the cult to its emancipatory mission, and those who see it as a Petro rite summoning the fierce and violent loa (Vodou spirits) of insurrection.<p></p>A more esoteric theory proposes that, through a special Petro-Zandor rite, an egregor of malevolent loa was created and that a character called Jean-Babtiste Vixamar Legrand offered himself up for sacrifice during the ceremony. Haiti’s historic misfortunes since the revolution, advocates of this theory claim, are a consequence of the egregor’s continued existence. Only after an unbinding rite will this conglomeration of dark-matter entities cease wreaking havoc in the country. For this presentation I will discuss the Simbi-Makaya thesis and the occult notion of the egregor, relating them to traditional accounts of the Bwa Kayiman ceremony and to the traditions of the Bizango secret societies of Haiti.</p>"

    "abstract": "<p>In this visual anthropological lecture, Dr. Dirk Schlottmann presents Korean shamanism in the new millennium. The lecture is on one hand designed as a short introduction to different ethnological theories and will help to understand the confusing tangle of definitions that goes along with the terms shamanism, musok and neoshamanism.  On the other hand, the collection of photographs in combination with the explanations will allow a rare and intimate view into the exotic, modern world of Korean shamans and transport a visual aesthetic of religion that is difficult to approach by words alone.<p>"

    "avatar-path": "images/speakers/arts-helene-red.jpg",
    "abstract": "<p>This presentation is a high-level overview of the Left-Hand Path practice of Magick.  The distinguishing feature of the Left-Hand Path is its assertion and reliance on Self as the primary source of power – this is in contrast to the belief in a power greater, or other, than Self (ie God/Goddess, the 'Universe', etc.), which is known as the Right-Hand Path. Note that the two paths are not divisive, but do represent the philosophical underpinnings of a given magickal practice. The presentation will be structured as follows: </p> <p> 1. Clear explanation of what the Left-Hand Path is, and isn’t, with examples and references.  </br> 2. Brief overview of some primary symbolic Left-Hand Path figures (ie Lilith, Lucifer, Satan etc) </br> 3. Philosophy and practice of the Left-Hand Path.  </br> 4. Commentary on past and modern contributors to the legacy left for 21st century Left-Hand Path magicians.  </br> 5. Research notes, bibliography and references for follow-up reading and study will be provided to participants.</p>"

    "abstract": "<p>On July 25th, 2014 the strange life of esoteric researcher Vincent Bridges ended just hours before the premiere of the play he had written about the life of Renaissance alchemist Edward Kelley in what he claimed was Edward Kelley’s house in Prague.  Bridges, who referred to himself as Dr. Strange because of all of the weird things that had happened in his life, supposedly died from a heart attack. Yet according to friends, shortly before his death he had recently been thanking everyone close to him, something that was totally out of character for him.  </p> <p> Most well known for his narration of several History Channel shows about Nostradamus and two books about Fucanelli, Vincent Bridges was researching the lost years of Shakespeare when he realized that no one had written a proper biography of the mysterious life of Edward Kelley.  From 2010 on, Bridges spent most of his time in Prague and greater Bohemia researching and writing about the legendary life of Edward Kelley, the secrets of the Enochian language, and the Ophanic Angelic Language transmitted to Dee and Kelley. Bridges conducted many talks and seminars that examined his theories about the Enochian language and the esoteric positioning of Prague.  </p> <p> Four years after his death, after editing by his former colleague Dr. Teresa Burns and his fiance Eliska Bridges, Bridges’ biography of Edward Kelley was finally published and released in May 2018 at a memorial held for Vincent Bridges in the same house where his play was to be performed, The Donkey and the Cradle. In his biography of Edward Kelley, Bridges made many wild and unsubstantiated original claims about Edward Kelley, John Dee, and Shakespeare.  This talk will examine the period of time Bridges spent in Prague and will highlight the original theories that he concocted and promoted.</p>"

    "title": "Reconfiguring the World: Automatic Writing and Authority in the 19 th Century",
    "avatar-path": "images/speakers/dickins-rob-red.png",
    "abstract": "<p>This talk will initially trace the pre-history of ‘automatic writing,’ arguing that it originated in the work of visionaries such as the theologian Emanuel Swedenborg, the prophet Joanna Southcott, and the poet William Blake, and contextualise its function in various domestic writing practices associated with family worship. It will explain how these elements had a direct influence on the popularisation of automatic writing in the 1850s, a development that coincided with the advent of Modern Spiritualism.  It will then trace the various conceptualizations of the writing technique by spiritualists and its critics over the latter half of the nineteenth century. This will provide a visceral snapshot into not only the tensions that arose between secular and spiritual discourse during the period, but also shows how these jarring modes of meaning-making merged to become the complex set of beliefs now understood as automatic writing.</p><p> At the core of this talk is an argument centred on spirit communication as a method for disrupting existing models of authority. This includes the way in which it redefines our relationship with the sacred, particularly away from religious models centred on church-going and into understanding the home and nature landscapes as spheres of spiritual authority. Furthermore, it disrupts notions of personal identity, and gives rise to changing social perceptions of gender roles and the limits of self- understanding. In doing so, it illuminates an important contradiction that permeates occulture generally; by disavowing authorship and authority in undertaking magical practice, the practitioner is simultaneously taking charge of reconfiguring the world, and subverting their place within it.</p>"

    "abstract": "<p> ROOTS IN THE HEART follows musician Jimmy Trash on a journey through parts of Southern and Eastern Europe that have managed to slip through time and retain their faith and practice of folk methods of healing, seeing and blessing.  </p> <p> Inspired by the words of the 16th century physician Paracelsus, “one must seek out old wives, gypsies, sorcerers, wandering tribes, old robbers, and such outlaws and take lessons from them“, Jimmy Trash travels through six countries actively participating in rituals that have been passed down in oral tradition for centuries. He meets and learns from Granny Whisperers, Roma, shamans and more, himself being the one to be “worked“ on and experiencing the actions.  </p> <p> Along the way he talks with younger people who have a connection with these traditions, in an attempt to obtain a modern view of the ancient techniques. Amongst them are descendants of these traditions who have the burden of keeping their grandparents‘ traditions alive, students of the older healers and ethnographers who study magic in an academic way.  </p> <p> Also featured heavily through the movie is the music and songs of the same communities dealing with everyday magic, as whenever you look for magic, music is never far away.  </p>"

    "abstract":"<p>'Mexico, The Land of the Dead' is a research on the effects of the Occult, Santeria, Witchcraft and the cult to the Santa Muerte in Mexico today. We know that this part of the world located in North America, -yes, please check again the map- and on the border to the United States has been terribly affected by the War on Drugs, Cartels, US-Imperialism, internal corruption, and a very dark wave of dead. Thousands of human beings are found decapitated, chopped up, tortured and killed on a daily basis. The most affected are young women and girls. The brutality behind many of this killings makes us think of a very dark cult spreading around the country in addition to military and police brutality. This is a battle of forces and we need to be aware who is in charge of the most violent crimes. This year the so called left won elections in Mexico which opens new posibilities for social action.</p><p>This presentation gives an overview of drugs, violence, political power and the occult behind the scenes. Our goal is to bring awareness and connect with other people how understand the power of rituals and ancestral knowledge. We need to fight back!</p>"
