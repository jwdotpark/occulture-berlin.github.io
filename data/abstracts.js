    "abstract": "<p>With the (forthcoming) release of their new book Lifting the Veil, Janet and Gavin discuss the history of Trance Prophesy in ancient and modern Witchcraft. During research for the book they went on a journey of discovery resulting in some interesting surprises regarding the origins of Drawing Down the Moon in modern Wicca. They cover from ancient Shamanism, through to the Sybils of Ancient Greece, the Vala of the Northern Europeans and of course through to the modern practise of Drawing Down the Moon. They also look at cross-overs with contemporary traditions such as Vodoun and Santeria, and the Spiritualist Revival of the 19th and early 20th Centuries.</p>"

    "abstract": "<p>The signal event of the Haitian Revolution was a Vodou ceremony that took place in Bwa Kayiman (Alligator Woods) in August 1791. According to popular legend the Houngan Dutty Boukman and Mambo Cecile Fatiman oversaw a rite in which a Kreyol pig was sacrificed to the Black God of the African slaves and to the Spirit of Liberty. Scholarly speculation about the specific nature of the rite is divided between those who believe it to have been a Dahomian blood-oath, binding the cult to its emancipatory mission, and those who see it as a Petro rite summoning the fierce and violent loa (Vodou spirits) of insurrection.<p></p>A more esoteric theory proposes that, through a special Petro-Zandor rite, an egregor of malevolent loa was created and that a character called Jean-Babtiste Vixamar Legrand offered himself up for sacrifice during the ceremony. Haiti’s historic misfortunes since the revolution, advocates of this theory claim, are a consequence of the egregor’s continued existence. Only after an unbinding rite will this conglomeration of dark-matter entities cease wreaking havoc in the country. For this presentation I will discuss the Simbi-Makaya thesis and the occult notion of the egregor, relating them to traditional accounts of the Bwa Kayiman ceremony and to the traditions of the Bizango secret societies of Haiti.</p>"

From the ninety-nine names of God to the graphic form of the Greatest Name (ism al-aʿẓam) to those conjuration names of power (ʿazāʾim) and the sigilic lunettes (aqlām) which evoke them, esotericism and the arcana found a fertile ground in Islamicate civilization beginning with those transmissions initially given by the Prophet Muḥammad’s own family and descendents, the Shiʿite Imāms.</p><p>In this presentation the overall landscape of Islamic occultism is briefly summarized with its central themes covered. Emphases will be placed on the fact that the occult and arcana have been literally present everywhere in pre-modern Islamic civilization, from texts to architecture to daily practice itself.</p>"

    "abstract": "<p>This talk will explore the use of psychoactive fumigations in magical ritual throughout history, with a special focus on the 18th and 19th centuries. Several Early Modern grimoires contain recipes for fumigations composed largely of solanaceous plants such as belladonna, mandrake, and henbane, as well as other psychoactive ingredients, including opium poppy and cannabis. These fumigations are often a component of rituals intended to conjure spirits. It is my contention that the powerful visionary qualities of the ingredients contributed greatly towards the perceived efficacy of such rituals.</p><p>This presentation will focus specifically on a series of experiments undertaken by 18th-century Christian mystic and esotericist Karl von Eckarthausen. It will also touch on the use of solanaceous preparations by a variety of other figures, including Paschal Beverly Randolph, Louis-Alphonse Cahagnet, George Henry Felt, and Emma Hardinge Britten, among others.</p><p>After tracing a historical outline of the use of these fumigations, I will examine their effects, discuss some specific recipes and their safety, and offer some comments regarding their applicability in modern divination and ritual.</p>"

    "avatarPath": "images/speakers/hunter-jack-red.png",
    "abstract": "<p>In recent years many social and cultural anthropologists have started to re-engage with questions of ontology (i.e., questions of what actually exists). The standard approach in the humanities and social sciences has been to ‘bracket’ out such issues, essentially ignoring the problem to get on with the task of studying systems of ‘culture’ and ‘belief’ (social facts). Another tendency has been to entirely dismiss other ontologies (models of what exists) as irrational and misguided, superseded by Western scientific rationalism's dominant materialist ontology. Anthropologists have, however recently started to engage directly with the ontological implications of their fieldwork experiences (concerns that often arise through fieldwork encounters with magic and the paranormal), and to question the dominance of materialist scientific rationalism as a mode of understanding and interacting with the world. This shift in perspective has been labelled the 'Ontological Turn' (Holbraad & Pedersen, 2017).</p><p>This talk will explore the ontological turn and its implications for our understanding of the paranormal, supernatural and occult. I will survey a variety of methodological frameworks for breaking down what I have called 'ontological flood barriers' in order to open up new avenues for engaging multiple ontologies in fieldwork and scholarship. The paper will examine the influence of Edith Turner's experiential and participatory approach (Turner, 1998), Fiona Bowie's notion of 'cognitive empathetic engagement' (Bowie, 2013), Merz and Merz's notion of the 'ontological penumbra' (Merz & Merz, 2017), and Zayin Cabot's 'ecologies of participation' (Cabot, 2018), amongst others. I will also explore my own concept of 'Ontological Flooding' (which takes inspiration from the work of Charles Fort, Robert Anton Wilson and others), and how I have used it in my research and writing to make sense of my own fieldwork experiences with contemporary trance and physical mediumship practitioners in Bristol (Hunter, 2015; 2017).</p>"

    "abstract": "<p>This lecture traces the double Damballa serpent of virtual reality’s twin ancestry in Paganism and Vodun, through its coding and its rituals. This doubling is inherent to cyberspace’s binary DNA. Virtual reality was mystically conceived in mathematician Vernor Vinge’s sci-fi writings, and, not coincidentally, inhabited by the ‘voodoo’ loa in William Gibson’s Count Zero.  The genealogy of cyberspace can be traced back to origins in West African Vodun that precede Western computation, Leibnitz’s binary code and geomancy by many centuries.</p><p>The term Technopagan, as coined by Erik Davis (1995), designates a range of practices: “goddess-worshippers, ceremonial magicians, witches, Radical Fairies” that were floating around the internet back then, and which have been resurfacing of late in new forms, in pockets of subcultural online communities. If Davis’ 90s technopaganism was largely US-based and made up of “almost exclusively white folks drawn from bohemian and middle-class enclaves”, its current, much more culturally diverse iteration, expresses a heritage that can be traced back to pre-colonial West African Vodun coding practices.</p><p>This lecture will take a binary approach, first looking at Mark Pesce’s ‘technopaganism’ and his development of virtual reality coding (VRML). It will investigate the technopagan concept of cyberspace, particularly the way this is structured through its VRML code. It will consider virtual reality’s psychic architectures, hermetic glyphs, idea spaces, sigils, and rituals performed on the virtual astral plane, beginning with its inauguration at Pesce’s Cybersamhain ritual.</p><p>It will then examine the origins of cyberspace’s coded ontologies, in both its digital and its analogue structures, from VRML to neural net computation and nonlinear phase-space, through African Vodun’s divination practices, doubling, geometric algorithms, and ritual drum pattern as communication systems with the dead.</p>"

Some of us have witnessed (and perhaps caused) vast changes in cultural and technological developments. Have we adapted our paradigms too or are we stuck in a nostalgic past, a distant country far from the reality of 21st century living? As we age, we accumulate experiences, lessons, a range of circumstances from which we have perceived the worlds around and within ourselves.

    "abstract": "<p>Best known to scholars of esotericism as the sociological category put forward by Christopher Partridge in The Re-Enchantment of the West (2004), occulture is rapidly becoming the word du jour in occultist circles. Partridge repurposed the term, which he initially came across in George McKay's Senseless Acts of Beauty, but subsequently traced back to artist, “esoterrorist” and self-styled “cultural engineer”, Genesis Breyer P-Orridge.</p><p>Occulture, as Christopher Partridge asserts, is ‘ordinary’; it is concurrent with all culture, the two are interrelated and analogous, indeed, occulture is an inseparable part of culture. Nevertheless, occulture is extraordinary, and it is revealed precisely by its deviance from normative culture—in its transgression of orthodox cultural meaning, dominant cultural narratives, and, even, so-called “normal waking consciousness”.</p><p>Most of the time, we are unaware that we are ‘reading’ our cultural environment, the narratives around which our lives are informed and organised have been so normalised that they usually run unawares, in the background. Occulture, however, is conspicuous. When we encounter a rupture in some aspect of normal or orthodox cultural meaning, we are forced to notice it and try and make sense of it: to interpret it. Although it is found everywhere within culture­, its very distinctive and differential presence invariably draws attention to, and is the expression of, something beyond culture. Occulture, is the revealed ‘face’ of the concealed.</p>"

Bridges, who referred to himself as Dr. Strange because of all of the weird things that had happened in his life, supposedly died from a heart attack. Yet according to friends, shortly before his death he had recently been thanking everyone close to him, something that was totally out of character for him.  </p> <p> Most well known for his narration of several History Channel shows about Nostradamus and two books about Fucanelli, Vincent Bridges was researching the lost years of Shakespeare when he realized that no one had written a proper biography of the mysterious life of Edward Kelley.  From 2010 on, Bridges spent most of his time in Prague and greater Bohemia researching and writing about the legendary life of Edward Kelley, the secrets of the Enochian language, and the Ophanic Angelic Language transmitted to Dee and Kelley. Bridges conducted many talks and seminars that examined his theories about the Enochian language and the esoteric positioning of Prague.  </p> <p> Four years after his death, after editing by his former colleague Dr. Teresa Burns and his fiance Eliska Bridges, Bridges’ biography of Edward Kelley was finally published and released in May 2018 at a memorial held for Vincent Bridges in the same house where his play was to be performed, The Donkey and the Cradle. In his biography of Edward Kelley, Bridges made many wild and unsubstantiated original claims about Edward Kelley, John Dee, and Shakespeare.

    "abstract": "<p>This talk will initially trace the pre-history of ‘automatic writing,’ arguing that it originated in the work of visionaries such as the theologian Emanuel Swedenborg, the prophet Joanna Southcott, and the poet William Blake, and contextualise its function in various domestic writing practices associated with family worship. It will explain how these elements had a direct influence on the popularisation of automatic writing in the 1850s, a development that coincided with the advent of Modern Spiritualism.  It will then trace the various conceptualizations of the writing technique by spiritualists and its critics over the latter half of the nineteenth century. This will provide a visceral snapshot into not only the tensions that arose between secular and spiritual discourse during the period, but also shows how these jarring modes of meaning-making merged to become the complex set of beliefs now understood as automatic writing.</p><p> At the core of this talk is an argument centred on spirit communication as a method for disrupting existing models of authority. This includes the way in which it redefines our relationship with the sacred, particularly away from religious models centred on church-going and into understanding the home and nature landscapes as spheres of spiritual authority. Furthermore, it disrupts notions of personal identity, and gives rise to changing social perceptions of gender roles and the limits of self- understanding. In doing so, it illuminates an important contradiction that permeates occulture generally; by disavowing authorship and authority in undertaking magical practice, the practitioner is simultaneously taking charge of reconfiguring the world, and subverting their place within it.</p>"
